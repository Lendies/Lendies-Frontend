We are targeting the Refi (Regenerative Finance) Prize. Our hack is the stepping stone for upward mobility. 
Data shows that it is expensive to not have funds available. It means that one may have to pay overdraft fees, have to take out high interest loans, and not have the luxury of buying in bulk among other problems. We help this problem by allowing employers to pay their staff in live time so they do not need to wait till payday to be paid. This more fair way of getting paid goes a long way. But we take this a step further. We believe that it is in the best interest of a employer to make sure that their community is thriving, so we created a way for the employer to loan money to their employees. 
These two features can also be the stepping stones for a universal credit score. As the data of the salary payment and the loan repayment will be saved so others can access and underwrite loans with this data. This can be the foundation for a global credit score and allow people to move freely and have a less biased way of borrowing.
