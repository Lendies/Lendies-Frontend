# Lendies

Lendies is a decentralized lending protocol enabling peer-to-peer token loan service.

## Vision

A large portion of the population may not have easy access to banks, loans, credit, or emergency finances. By establishing a decentralized lending system, we introduce the idea of on-chain credit based on an individual's debt/income ratio. This allows us to help address the problem of financial inclusion for nearly 30% of the world population.

First, our focus is credibility in peer-to-peer lending. Initially, we will establish proof-of-concept by implementing friend-to-friend or family-to-family lending capability.

## Proof-of-Concept
User feedback was obtained in the form of "Would you use an app that enables ____?". Requesting feedback in this manner has resulted in all positive feedback, thus guiding us to our first use-case proof-of-concept milestone.

An example useage scenario may look as follows: 
1. User A wants to borrow money from User B. 
2. User A scans a QR code provided by User B. 
3. User A sends a loan request to User B.
4. User B accepts(/denies) loan request.
5. User A receives lump-sum loan amount from User B.
6. User B receives "stream" from User A.
